## About LISA 2020 Network

The LISA 2020 Global Network trains statisticians and data scientists from developing countries to become interdisciplinary collaborators and supports them in the creation of statistics and data science collaboration laboratories - [stat labs](https://www.lisa2020.org/labs) - at their home institutions. Stat labs are training the next generation of collaborative statisticians and data scientists and providing critical research infrastructure to apply statistics and data science to transform evidence into action toward solving real-world problems. 

If you have a stat lab or wants to create one in a developing country, feel free to [contact us](https://www.lisa2020.org/about/processes-and-policies).
